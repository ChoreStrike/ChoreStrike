# Backlog — Open Items

> **Single source of truth for everything not yet done.** Entries are organized
> into the five dependency-oriented sections fixed by
> [CS-PLAN-058 §2.2](../plans/done/cs-plan-058-core-workflow-bottom-up-masterplan.md):
> **Core Workflow Program**, **Core Hardening**, **Deferred Add-ons**,
> **Infrastructure and Documentation**, and **Release**. Every open entry carries
> the standardized metadata block (see [`README.md`](README.md) for the format).
> **Done work does not live here** — completed items move to
> [`archive/YYYY-MM.md`](archive/) at completion. `npm run backlog:check`

## Core Workflow Program

> The CR-WF umbrellas owned the core-journey acceptance criteria
> ([CS-PLAN-058](../plans/done/cs-plan-058-core-workflow-bottom-up-masterplan.md);
> review record: [`archive/CODE_REVIEW_2026-09-02.md`](archive/CODE_REVIEW_2026-09-02.md)).
> **Program closure 2026-09-14:** CR-WF-01..08 and every plan-owned item are
> archived; the final Full review (`PASS-WITH-FIXES`, D-FR-03 disposition)
> folded the remaining service-level pointers into their concrete owners
> (CR-053-11, CR-053-19) and re-sectioned the non-blocking remainders. This
> section is intentionally empty — no open item blocks or extends the core
> program.

*(No open items — the program's acceptance lives in CS-PLAN-058 §8; follow-up
findings of the final review are routed to Core Hardening / Deferred Add-ons
below.)*

## Core Hardening

> Standalone correctness, API, persistence, i18n, and security remainders. Each
> entry states which work package it blocks (CS-PLAN-058 §2.2).

### [P4] CR-PERF-01 — SchedulePlanService apply O(n²) row scans
**Status**: Backlog · **Effort**: XS · **Layer**: backend · **Journey stage**: scheduling
**Owning**: — · **Depends on**: — · **Blocks**: — · **Folded-in**: —
**Source**: Review of CS-PLAN-058 (final Full review, 2026-09-14; RF-058-14)

`SchedulePlanService::apply` calls `findRowById` (linear scan of
`plan['response']['changes']`) inside the loop over changed room-task ids for
both the due-date and assignee phases — O(n²) scans, though in-memory only and
bounded by ≤100 changed rows (no queries, no frozen-budget impact). Fix: key
the changes array by roomTaskId once before the loops.

---

## Deferred Add-ons

> Explicitly outside the core critical path (CS-PLAN-058 §1.3). These cannot
> enter the critical path without a plan update.

The section reflects CS-PLAN-058's historical grouping. The CS-PLAN-070 draft
now explicitly selects notification settings and dated pauses for its new core,
followed by the optional family catalog; those choices do not activate code work.

### [P3] FEAT-UX-015 — Leave house (self-service membership exit)
**Status**: Open (semantics decided, endpoint/UI open; re-sectioned from the Core Workflow Program section 2026-09-14, D-FR-03) · **Effort**: M · **Layer**: backend+frontend · **Journey stage**: authorization
**Owning**: unassigned · **Depends on**: — · **Blocks**: — · **Folded-in**: —
**Source**: UX-003 remainder (CS-PLAN-038); owner-transfer/last-owner semantics decided by CS-PLAN-061 D6 (ADR-010, user-ratified 2026-09-03)

Members cannot leave a house on their own; removal is owner-only. The
owner-transfer semantics are decided (D6): the **last owner cannot leave** —
ownership must be transferred first (consistent with `CANNOT_REMOVE_OWNER` /
`CANNOT_DEMOTE_LAST_OWNER`; an ownerless house would allow stranger
re-bootstrap). Remaining: the backend leave endpoint + Settings action.

- [x] Decide owner-transfer/last-owner semantics for leaving. (D6, ADR-010, 2026-09-03)
- [ ] Backend leave endpoint (+ guards) + Settings Leave button + tests.

### [P3] FEAT-UX-018 — Task-approval workflow for children
**Status**: Backlog · **Effort**: L · **Layer**: backend+frontend · **Journey stage**: task approval
**Owning**: unassigned · **Depends on**: — · **Blocks**: — · **Folded-in**: CONCEPT-001
**Source**: Review of docs/concepts/ui-use-cases.md (2026-08-21)

design.md §5 lists "task approval workflow for children"; gamification open
decisions touch it too. Today every completion is final immediately.

**2026-09-17 decision (CS-PLAN-070 D8/D11):** routine chore completion remains
immediate; child reward redemption has separate owner approval. A general chore
approval queue is explicitly outside that delivery slice, not a prerequisite for
the new rhythm model. This item remains a future option requiring a new decision.

- [x] First-slice decision: keep immediate completion; defer general chore approval.
- [ ] Revisit optional quality review only after a separate product decision.
- [ ] If selected, backend: needs-review state + owner approve/reject endpoints with
      membership/owner gating + tests.
- [ ] Owner approval queue UI + child-facing "waiting for approval" feedback.

### [P4] FEAT-UX-019 — Task Pass & support actions (gag mechanic)
**Status**: Backlog · **Effort**: M · **Layer**: backend+frontend · **Journey stage**: gamification
**Owning**: unassigned · **Depends on**: — · **Blocks**: — · **Folded-in**: CONCEPT-001
**Source**: Review of docs/concepts/ui-use-cases.md (2026-08-21)

gamification-and-rewards.md sketches a post-MVP "Task Pass" gag mechanic;
explicitly future / needs decision.

CS-PLAN-070 D11 explicitly defers this feature outside the first delivery slice
(2026-09-17). Transferring chores without agreement would conflict with the
approved responsibility model; a future product decision is still required.

- [ ] Product decision whether the gag mechanic fits the target audience.
- [ ] Only after decision: concept extension + endpoint design sketch.

---

### [P3] FEAT-UX-023 — Onboarding & help layer
**Status**: In Progress - WP6 essential help slice DELIVERED 2026-09-30; WP8 essential onboarding/catalog/contextual-help slice DELIVERED 2026-10-02 via CS-PLAN-079 (five contextual topics on the shared named Modal plus reward glossary terms); wider tour scope remains open · **Effort**: M · **Layer**: frontend · **Journey stage**: onboarding
**Owning**: CS-PLAN-077 WP6 (delivered); CS-PLAN-070 WP8 (essential slice); wider guided tour/help unassigned · **Depends on**: — · **Blocks**: — · **Folded-in**: CONCEPT-001
**Source**: Review of docs/concepts/ui-use-cases.md (2026-08-21)

**WP6 slice delivered (2026-09-30):** [CS-PLAN-077](../plans/done/cs-plan-077-wp6-calm-core-ui.md)
delivered the essential slice as ONE navigation-level entry
(`HelpEntry.vue` + `HelpGlossary.vue`, always reachable from the nav,
modal glossary) instead of per-view entry points — one always-visible
entry beat three scattered ones (scope consolidation recorded in the
plan's Review Findings). WP8 continues the parent's essential account/role,
share/rhythm/pause and catalog/contextual-help slice; whole-item closure still
requires any broader guided tour/help scope to be completed or explicitly scoped.

The navigation glossary is delivered. Contextual hints and onboarding/catalog
guidance remain; a wider guided tour is not implied by the essential WP8 slice.

Family-rhythm clarification (CS-PLAN-070 D10): explain existing Nextcloud
accounts for children, wizard member invites versus child-role setup, shared
device sign-in and optional work versus personal commitments. No local child
profile or guardian-consent model should be implied by onboarding copy.

- [x] Help entry point reachable from the navigation (WP6 delivered one
      nav-level entry; per-view contextual entry points remain WP8).
- [x] Glossary unifying the core household vocabulary (Agreement,
      Catch-up, Pause, Streak, Quiet time, Ranking, Arcade, Coins).
- [x] Contextual hints for the selected model (accounts/roles, agreements/shares,
      progress/windows, catalog gates, owner pricing) as manually triggered
      context topics — delivered with the WP8 slice 2026-10-02; do not teach
      removed combo/freeze mechanics as target behavior.
- [x] Detail the essential WP8 slice and its tests in [CS-PLAN-079](../plans/done/cs-plan-079-wp8-reward-ui-and-onboarding.md) (2026-10-02;
      documentation only, no activation or runtime implementation).
- [ ] Complete wider guided tour/help scope separately before whole-item closure.

### [P4] FEAT-UX-027 — Print view (weekly plan / calendar)
**Status**: Backlog · **Effort**: S · **Layer**: frontend · **Journey stage**: print view
**Owning**: unassigned · **Depends on**: — · **Blocks**: — · **Folded-in**: —
**Source**: Review of docs/concepts/ui-use-cases.md (2026-08-21)

Future: paper-friendly weekly plan for fridge-door households.

- [ ] Print styles or dedicated print route reusing CalendarView range data.
- [ ] No new endpoints unless a gap is proven.

### [P3] FEAT-UX-028 — Global search
**Status**: Backlog · **Effort**: M · **Layer**: backend+frontend · **Journey stage**: search
**Owning**: unassigned · **Depends on**: — · **Blocks**: — · **Folded-in**: —
**Source**: Review of docs/concepts/ui-use-cases.md (2026-08-21)

Global search has no UI. **Status correction (2026-10-03):** the old
`GET /tasks/search` route and `searchTasks` wrapper were already pruned; do not
plan against an existing endpoint/wrapper. A future implementation must define
the actual search contract, not revive a dead API by assumption.

- [ ] Search entry point covering task definitions + room tasks (NC search
      integration or in-app field).
- [ ] Define the API or Nextcloud integration needed for the selected search scope.
- [ ] Tests.

---

### [P4] FEAT-UX-029 — Bulk maintenance ops
**Status**: Backlog · **Effort**: M · **Layer**: backend+frontend · **Journey stage**: bulk maintenance
**Owning**: unassigned · **Depends on**: — · **Blocks**: — · **Folded-in**: —
**Source**: Review of docs/concepts/ui-use-cases.md (2026-08-21)

Future: owner tools to reschedule/clear overdue tasks in bulk and seasonally
deactivate/reactivate by filter (cf. the CS-PLAN-042 bulk-endpoint pattern).

- [ ] Server-side bulk reschedule endpoint + owner action on the overdue list.
- [ ] Seasonal deactivate/reactivate by filter (room/category/idle).
- [ ] Styled confirmations per cross-cutting conventions + tests.

### [P4] UX-017 — AvailabilitySettings day-item border hexes bypass tokens
**Status**: Backlog · **Effort**: XS · **Layer**: frontend · **Journey stage**: theming
**Owning**: unassigned · **Depends on**: — · **Blocks**: — · **Folded-in**: —
**Source**: CS-PLAN-044 known remaining, logged by Standard-B review (2026-08-23)

`AvailabilitySettings.vue` day-item borders hardcode `#4caf50`/`#f44336`
(~lines 449/454). Outside the CS-PLAN-044 swept-component list; replace with
`var(--color-success)`/`var(--color-error)` when a dark-mode pass touches the
component.

### [P3] TECH-TRANSPORT-001 — Attribute intermittent browser API connection termination
**Status**: Backlog · **Effort**: S · **Layer**: tooling · **Journey stage**: test-runtime reliability
**Owning**: unassigned · **Depends on**: — · **Blocks**: — · **Folded-in**: —
**Source**: installation follow-up qualification, 2026-10-09 (`run-J0ndFy`; sanitized summary in [the handoff](../testing/install-preparation-2026-10-08.md#diagnostic-boundaries))

An NC35 browser API GET terminated before any HTTP response during parallel
local runtime qualification. Retained traces exclude an early context close or
fixture teardown, but do not identify the terminating layer. This is distinct
from the reproduced application races, which were repaired. Both subsequent
complete sequential v4 gates pass without retries or skipped required tests.

The initial v5 NC35 full gate later also recorded fixture seed POST failures
(`fetch failed`, cause `SocketError: other side closed`) before application
assertions, followed by an outer runner timeout. No restart/OOM or Apache fatal
event was found. A controlled keep-alive hypothesis did not reproduce failure;
no request-retry or speculative header change was made. The affected suite
passes in isolation. Retain this additional evidence; do not narrow the item
to parallel-runtime load or claim that the transport cause has been established.
The complete unchanged-source NC35 requalification `run-RPFVu9` subsequently
passes all 295 executions without retries; that does not close this attribution
item or erase the failed run.

**Deferral reason / scope:** attribution needs separate test-runtime/transport
instrumentation and load comparison; it is not an outstanding bootstrap or
Settings implementation criterion. Passing sequential gates are not proof of
parallel-runtime reliability. No request-error filter or retry workaround was
introduced, and raw traces/headers remain private.

- [ ] Correlate sanitized client, server and Docker lifecycle evidence to identify the terminating layer.
- [ ] Compare isolated and parallel runtime execution without changing required assertions or mutation retry semantics.
- [ ] Fix a reproducible cause and add a targeted regression; otherwise record the bounded attribution result and remaining uncertainty.

### [P1] CONCEPT-001 — Family-first rhythm and reward contracts
**Status**: In Progress — CS-PLAN-070 activated via Standard A `PASS-WITH-FIXES` (2026-09-18) · **Effort**: XL implementation (clarification was M) · **Layer**: docs+backend+frontend · **Journey stage**: product definition
**Owning**: CS-PLAN-070 · **Depends on**: — · **Blocks**: — · **Folded-in**: —
**Source**: User-requested family-first concept review (2026-09-16)

[CS-PLAN-070](../plans/active/cs-plan-070-family-rhythm-and-reward-clarification.md)
is the decision register and owning review-finding record. The user approved
24 core choices across D1-D11 and 47 C1-C5 answers (6/11/9/8/13) on 2026-09-17;
the technical draft added on 2026-09-18 maps schema/APIs, transactions/races,
exact files/tests and ten work packages (48-76 engineering days before contingency,
plus two weeks of voluntary family use). Q-070-01/02 on structural-deletion history
and true account erasure were answered in the 2026-09-18 Standard A review
(tombstoned minimum-history retention; account erasure/anonymization), which
passed with `PASS-WITH-FIXES` and activated the plan; the earlier dismissed
question batch was never counted as consent.
Runtime findings stay in that plan, not parallel backlog entries. Existing
add-on owners remain; notification/pause work belongs
to the selected core and the optional catalog follows it. Chore approval/Task Pass,
external sync, local child profiles, cosmetics and non-Snake games are outside
this delivery slice. No item is completed by the WP0 delivery alone.
WP0 (write/identity foundation) was sub-planned and delivered by the child
[CS-PLAN-071](../plans/done/cs-plan-071-wp0-write-identity-foundation.md)
(Standard A `PASS-WITH-FIXES` 2026-09-18; **final Standard B
`PASS-WITH-FIXES` 2026-09-19, plan in `done/`**): house-first lock order,
Version1030 commands/wallets/wallet_entries, wallet identity at every
membership path, `CommandService`, tombstone deletion with retained
evidence, account erasure + `UserDeletedListener`, T0 suites. WP1
(occurrence timeline) was sub-planned and delivered by the child
[CS-PLAN-072](../plans/done/cs-plan-072-wp1-occurrence-timeline.md)
(Standard A `PASS` 2026-09-20; **final Standard B `PASS-WITH-FIXES`
2026-09-23, plan in `done/`**): immutable rule revisions, stable occurrence
keys, saved windows/time basis, deterministic target selection, write-free
projections, `TimelineJob`, completion identity via `CommandService`
receipts, occurrence-scoped checklist/undo, current-client integration
and — per Q-072-01 Option A — the minimal common agreement writer with
`agreements` persistence and the necessary C2
deadline/authorization/capacity checks; ADR-013 recorded. The WP3+
behavior packages remain open in the parent; CONCEPT-001 remains open.
WP2 was sub-planned as [CS-PLAN-073](../plans/done/cs-plan-073-wp2-agreements-capacity-pauses.md)
(Standard A `PASS-WITH-FIXES` 2026-09-23; final Standard B `PASS-WITH-FIXES`
2026-09-25 — delivered; Q-073-01/02/03 resolved with the
recommended options, including the frozen cross-zone capacity/pause comparison):
agreements, exact planned shares, whole-day capacity, pauses, catch-up/restart
and midnight-stale 409, with concrete test/file ownership and explicit
WP3/WP4/WP5/WP6 handoffs. WP2 is delivered; later packages remain open.
WP3 was sub-planned and delivered by the child
[CS-PLAN-074](../plans/done/cs-plan-074-wp3-work-accounting-and-replay.md)
(activated 2026-09-25, Standard A `PASS`; **final Standard B re-review
`PASS-WITH-FIXES` 2026-09-27, plan in `done/`**): actual shares, exact
minor-unit wallet accounting (sole ledger authority, ADR-014), targeted
undo/attribution with departed-wallet conservation, room journal/replay
(CR-SVC-63 closed), the Q-074-01A rhythm/weekly/retained-recognition
correction closure, retention/erasure sweeps and the minimal client/no-Coin
arcade cutover; RF-074-WP3-01..10 resolved. Later packages (WP4+) remain
open in the parent; CONCEPT-001 remains open.
WP4 (rhythm/goals/ranking) was sub-planned as
[CS-PLAN-075](../plans/done/cs-plan-075-wp4-rhythm-goals-and-ranking.md)
(activated 2026-09-27 via Standard A `PASS-WITH-FIXES`; Q-075-01/02 Option A
selected) and **delivered** (final Standard B `PASS-WITH-FIXES` 2026-09-29):
rhythm/goal read contract, consent-filtered ranking with real
consent persistence in WP4,
single-series retained recognition and retired-mechanic removal (ADR-015).
WP5 (preferences/digest delivery) was sub-planned as
[CS-PLAN-076](../plans/done/cs-plan-076-wp5-preferences-and-digest-delivery.md)
(final Standard B `PASS-WITH-FIXES` 2026-09-30; delivered with ADR-016,
self-only preferences, quiet shared digest and complete T7 evidence).

WP6 (calm core UI) was sub-planned as
[CS-PLAN-077](../plans/done/cs-plan-077-wp6-calm-core-ui.md) and activated
2026-09-30 via Standard A `PASS-WITH-FIXES` (Q-077-01..05 all Option A);
**delivered** (final Standard B `PASS-WITH-FIXES` 2026-10-01): all-age My Day
landing/content, preference-gated calm feedback, full
`NotificationPreferences.vue` + optional-area consumers, pause UI, occurrence
agreement entry points, shared-device store reset, no-Coin closure and the
essential help slice; FEAT-UX-024/025 closed with it.
WP7 was delivered via [CS-PLAN-078](../plans/done/cs-plan-078-wp7-catalog-and-request-backend.md)
(final Standard B `PASS-WITH-FIXES` 2026-10-01; catalog/C4 backend, ADR-017).
WP8 was delivered via [CS-PLAN-079](../plans/done/cs-plan-079-wp8-reward-ui-and-onboarding.md)
(final Standard B `PASS-WITH-FIXES` 2026-10-02: reward UI/onboarding, two catalog gates,
persistent request surfaces, exact prices, uncertain-command replay, essential help).
CONCEPT-001 remains In Progress for WP9 (cross-DB/family evidence) — the closing gate.
WP9 is planned as [CS-PLAN-080](../plans/active/cs-plan-080-wp9-cross-db-and-family-evidence.md)
(drafted 2026-10-02, activated 2026-10-03 via Standard A `PASS`, zero findings;
WP9 owner): isolated MariaDB/PostgreSQL/SQLite verification,
two consecutive combined browser gates and voluntary adult/child comprehension
plus 14-day everyday-use evidence. Its NC31 technical matrix and consecutive
browser pair passed on 2026-10-05; human coordination, guardian consent and
minimum voluntary participation were confirmed on 2026-10-07, but comprehension
and 14-day evidence remain uncollected.
The separate TECH-RUNTIME-001 qualification is delivered by CS-PLAN-082
(final Full `PASS-WITH-FIXES` 2026-10-06, archived); the old-runtime passes remain
historical and do not replace its NC35/NC34 evidence or authorize retained use.

**Pre-WP9 preparation delivered (2026-10-05):**
[CS-PLAN-081](../plans/done/cs-plan-081-pre-wp9-hardening-and-retained-data-readiness.md)
passed its final Full review (`PASS-WITH-FIXES`).
Its bounded H4 reset-copy clarification contributes to this existing parent
owner; H6 retained-data/deployment preparation belongs to RELEASE-002. It does
not close parent findings or replace WP9 evidence.

- [x] Core D1-D11 choices recorded through 24 explicit answers (2026-09-17).
- [x] Six C1 and eleven C2 choices recorded with future acceptance scenarios (2026-09-17).
- [x] Nine C3 choices recorded with accounting/replay design consequences and future scenarios (2026-09-17).
- [x] Eight C4 choices recorded with a durable actor/state matrix and future scenarios (2026-09-17).
- [x] Thirteen C5 choices recorded with delivery/UI/consent contracts, future scenarios and a family-test protocol (2026-09-17).
- [x] Specify technical cross-contract draft, exact file/test manifest, work-package owners/dependencies and estimates (2026-09-18; not implementation approval).
- [x] Resolve Q-070-01/02 explicitly and have Standard A accept the integrated design before activation (2026-09-18: tombstone retention + account erasure; Standard A `PASS-WITH-FIXES`).
- [ ] Resolve the plan's findings or explicitly rescope to named owners before completion.

### [P4] TECH-DIGEST-001 — `DigestChangeMapper::expireQueuedBefore` uses `setMaxResults()` on an UPDATE
**Status**: Backlog · **Effort**: S · **Layer**: backend · **Journey stage**: digest maintenance
**Owning**: unassigned · **Depends on**: — · **Blocks**: — · **Folded-in**: —
**Source**: Review of CS-PLAN-078 WP7 final Standard B (2026-10-01)

Doctrine DBAL's `getSQLForUpdate()` never emits LIMIT (verified on the NC31
container), so the documented 500-row batch bound in
`DigestChangeMapper::expireQueuedBefore()` never applies — the expiry sweep
updates ALL matching queued rows in one statement. The expiry path is a
maintenance sweep (not the hot digest pass), so the current behavior is
functionally correct and merely unbounded; either drop the limit parameter
and document unbounded expiry, or implement chunked expiry via a bounded
SELECT of ids followed by UPDATE ... WHERE id IN (...). Not a WP7 regression
(pre-existing WP5 defect).

### [P3] BUG-SEC-001 — Security reporting contact for later external use
**Status**: Backlog (user-deferred 2026-10-04; outside CS-PLAN-081, not completed) · **Effort**: S · **Layer**: docs · **Journey stage**: security reporting
**Owning**: unassigned · **Depends on**: — · **Blocks**: RELEASE-002 (external-use stage only) · **Folded-in**: H7/H-T11 user rescoping and future GitHub-associated email contact (2026-10-04)
**Source**: CS-001 security review; CS-PLAN-081 H7 Post-Review Scope Decision

The operator initially tests alone and explicitly removed H7/H-T11 from
[CS-PLAN-081](../plans/done/cs-plan-081-pre-wp9-hardening-and-retained-data-readiness.md)
on 2026-10-04. No new reporting address or channel test is required for that
self-test stage or preparation-plan completion. This item remains open for
later external tester onboarding / public release, not a completed H7 claim.

Use ordinary private email without mandatory GPG, a dedicated `security@`
mailbox or Codeberg profile publication. The intended address is the new
GitHub-associated email, coordinated with the possible forge move in
TECH-REPO-001. It must be a monitored, deliverable mailbox, not a GitHub
commit-only `noreply` address. No address is currently supplied or approved
for publication; no account, mailbox or external profile action is authorized.

- [ ] Confirm the operator-approved reporting mailbox and receipt of a test email.
- [ ] Publish the approved contact in `docs/SECURITY.md` and align links with the selected hosting platform; no public security issues or sensitive real-user payloads.
- [ ] Remove the deferred-contact maintainer note once the route is available; GPG remains optional, not a completion requirement.

### [P3] TECH-REPO-001 — Evaluate Codeberg-to-GitHub migration
**Status**: Backlog (candidate move, not yet approved) · **Effort**: M · **Layer**: tooling+docs · **Journey stage**: repository hosting
**Owning**: unassigned · **Depends on**: — · **Blocks**: — · **Folded-in**: —
**Source**: user request 2026-10-04; future contact setup related to BUG-SEC-001

The user expects a possible move from Codeberg to GitHub and intends to use a
new GitHub-associated email for the later security contact. This is a separate
effort, not a CS-PLAN-081 prerequisite or authorization to transfer anything.

- [ ] Decide the target repository/account and migration scope with the operator.
- [ ] Inventory Git history/tags, issues, release assets, remotes, documentation links and Forgejo CI/release workflows; scope GitHub equivalents and private credential handling before implementation.
- [ ] After explicit migration approval, verify the transferred scope and update canonical links/workflows; coordinate the actual reporting mailbox with BUG-SEC-001.

## Release

> Stage path: `v0.8.x` alpha → `v0.9.x` beta → `v1.0.0` stable (manual install).
> App Store submission is explicitly deferred until stable quality is proven.

### [P2] RELEASE-002 — Beta deployment + real-world alpha usage
**Status**: Backlog · **Effort**: M · **Layer**: — · **Journey stage**: release
**Owning**: unassigned · **Depends on**: CS-PLAN-058 WP1..WP9 exit gates + final Full review PASS · **Blocks**: RELEASE-003 · **Folded-in**: retained-data trial readiness and safe recovery boundary (2026-10-03 user request); concrete AIO installation handoff/runbook gaps (2026-10-07); bounded remaining build/test dependency disposition (2026-10-08 user decision)
**Source**: staged release effort (roadmap); blocking-gate list fixed by CS-PLAN-058 §2.2/§3

Deploy to a personal Nextcloud instance; verify no impact on other apps;
real-world `v0.8.x` alpha usage; (optional) private tester onboarding for
`v0.9.x` beta with structured feedback intake.

The generic deployment guide still needs a verified production package manifest,
target-specific AIO commands and a concrete adoption record before independent
execution. Resolve these in the deployment work, not by guessing container paths
or treating the disposable test stack as a family installation. The 2026-10-07
entry-document refresh adds safety boundaries, not a completed AIO runbook.

The [2026-10-08 app qualification](../testing/install-preparation-2026-10-08.md)
owns the corrected asset contract, exact candidate artifact and renewed runtime
evidence. Six remaining build/test advisory roots are explicitly deferred here
under bounded trusted-input/no-production-tooling conditions. Recheck stable
fixes and review any necessary peer/engine migration before later builds; this
is not operator risk acceptance, production approval or resolution of NC34's
separately recorded native third-party platform failure.

Exact blocking gates:
- [x] CS-PLAN-058 WP1..WP9 exit gates, each passed with its Standard B review
      (program closed; plan in `done/` 2026-09-16).
- [x] Final Full review of the complete owner/member/child journey: `PASS` or
  `PASS-WITH-FIXES` (CS-PLAN-058 §3 WP9) — Full review `PASS-WITH-FIXES`
  2026-09-14 incl. the D-FR-04 browser-gate pair.

The existing-runtime WP9 technical/provider and browser-pair gates passed on
2026-10-05. TECH-RUNTIME-001's current-stable qualification is delivered by
[CS-PLAN-082](../plans/done/cs-plan-082-current-stable-test-baseline-and-data-preservation.md)
(final Full `PASS-WITH-FIXES` 2026-10-06): NC35 primary/NC34 AIO row, all providers,
populated preservation/recovery, canonical/CI promotion and the post-repair browser
pair pass. Still blocking: explicit safe deployment/adoption decisions and the
deployment/field-usage work itself. This is not a deployment or retained-baseline sign-off.
SEC-AUDIT-001 is completed by CS-PLAN-081 (2026-10-05), not a deployment sign-off.
BUG-SEC-001 remains required before later external tester onboarding / public
release, but is explicitly not a blocker for operator-only self-testing or
CS-PLAN-081 completion (user decision 2026-10-04). This limited exception does
not waive deployment safety, technical readiness or retained-baseline adoption.

**Retained-data preparation delivered (2026-10-05):**
[CS-PLAN-081](../plans/done/cs-plan-081-pre-wp9-hardening-and-retained-data-readiness.md)
H6 (final Full `PASS-WITH-FIXES`; Q-081-01 resolved to post-WP9 baseline
adoption) documents the first protected build/adoption boundary, future
data-preserving migration rules, synthetic recovery rehearsal and truthful
whole-Nextcloud rollback impact. This is a partial contribution, not deployment
or field-usage completion. The intended family candidate must pass
CS-PLAN-080's technical matrix/browser gates before real retained data; human
evidence then remains with CS-PLAN-080/CONCEPT-001. No premature
productive-use declaration or circular prerequisite on a completed human trial
is introduced.
